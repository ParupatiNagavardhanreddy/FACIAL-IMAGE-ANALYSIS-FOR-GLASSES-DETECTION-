# FACIAL-IMAGE-ANALYSIS-FOR-GLASSES-DETECTION-
A deep learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial images as with glasses or without glasses. The model is trained on labeled face images and deployed with a Gradio interface for real-time prediction, suitable for applications in biometrics, security, and personalized user experiences.
